//! Dim is a media manager written in rust.
//! It uses Diesel as the ORM and rocket for the http/s server
//!
//! The project is split up into several crates:
//! * [`database`](database) - Holds all the database models including some frequently used db operations
//! * [`routes`](routes) - All of the routes that we expose over http are stored in there
//! * [`scanners`](scanners) - The filesystem scanner and daemon code is located here
//! ffmpeg that is used by several parts of dim
//!
//! # Building
//! Dim can easily be built with cargo build --release.
//! When built with --release, build.rs will compile the web ui and embed it into dim.
//!
//! # To run
//! Dim can be ran using docker, by pulling vgarleanu/dim-server, or locally.
//! If ran locally, make sure PostgreSQL is running with the password for postgres: dimpostgres
//!
//! # Testing
//! To test run `make test` in the root, or `cargo test` in the root of each module including the
//! root dir.
